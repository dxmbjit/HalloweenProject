<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: orange;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;">The modern-day Halloween is largely agreed to have originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, held around November 1st , the date that marked the transition from autumn to winter. It was this time of year where people believed the boundary between the worlds of living and dead became blurred, and was when the souls of the dead were said to revisit their homes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: orange;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;">In the era of Christianity, this tradition became absorbed into the celebration of All Saints Day, held on November 1st, dedicated to honouring all saints and martyrs. The November 2nd became All Souls’ Day, a day to honour the dead, and here many of the Celtic traditions, such as bonfires, parades and dressing up in costume, blurred with Christian celebrations, to form festivities accepted, and even encouraged, by church authorities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: orange;margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;">The practice of decorating ‘jack o’lanterns’ is believed to have originated from an Irish folktale – about a man named Jack cursed to spend all of time roaming the earth with only a burning coal to light the way, as his punishment for trying to trick the devil. </p>
